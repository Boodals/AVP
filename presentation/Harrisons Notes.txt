Previous Client Example

We were approached by a client who was making a film, and needed massive sets. Instead of wasting hundreds of man-hours on computer generated scenes, which look unrealistic, we instead built the worlds.

They asked for 3 worlds, all totally different.

[Talk about each world briefly]
Each world has a surface area of approximately 150km squared, about 35% larger than the city of Bristol. Normally that would take decades to build and develop, but thanks to our localized time-shift technology, we built all three worlds in 8 and a half hours.


Make it past tense? "We predict constuction to take 8 and a half hours"
