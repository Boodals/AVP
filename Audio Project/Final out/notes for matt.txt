hi matt!!!

just some last minute things I noticed in your audio track that I would have changed but couldnt, none of its crucial, just my thoughts

line up electric motor sounds for strider to be right before impact sounds
audio crackling? at 00:04-00:09, could be footsteps sounds?
whoosh sound at 00:22, not sure if it makes sense, but I didnt notice it for ages so it might be good
